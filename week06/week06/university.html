          <h2>The School of hard knocks</h2>
          <p class="content-para" > Welcome to the school of hard knocks.  Sometimes in life things do not go your way. We help to turn those hiccups into life lessons.  Other schools just use busywork so you can earn those credits. We give you credits for the work that has kept you busy.  </p>

          <h2>Give us a try.</h2>
          <p class="content-para" >For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less tout and stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter. Their height is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure. They seldom now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they say, and in ancient days they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son of Isengrim the Second, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He was surpassed in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of old; but that curious matter is dealt with in this book.
