          <p class="content-para" >My philosophy about life is to live it with no regrets. And so, to live a life without regrets, I decided to go back to school so that I could increase my knowledge.   As for this web class, my philosophy is <a href="https://picsum.photos/">picsum.photo</a> is your friend.  You will notice the images on this page are all provided by picsum.

          <p class="content-para" >My wife and I have been married for 13 years. We have two daughters, ages 7 and 3 (turns four next week).  My wife and I have traveled the world together and seen many great things already. But our favorite place to travel is to see family, wherever they might be; but Disneyland is a close second...</p>

          <h2>I enjoy baseball</h2>
          <p class="content-para" >I grew up in a house full of girls.  One way that my dad got his guy time was coaching my little league teams. He coached me 5 out of 7 years.  Baseball has been a pastime of mine for several decades.  I am a Chicago Cubs fan. And no, not a passing fan, but a third-generation die-hard fan.  I couldn't talk for days after they won the world series.</p>

          <h2>Love/Hate</h2>
          <p class="content-para" >I have a love/hate relationship with gardening.  We are lucky enough to have a yard with enough substance to allow for us to have a few garden plots, fruit trees, shade, and lots of grass.  I love that we can experience nature just outside our door.  The fruits and vegetables are fantastic. We have flowers year-round.  All these things I love. I hate (yes, I know that is a strong word), hate, hate, weeds, and weeding.  Our yard has some sort of superpower that enables weeds to ignore any weed treatment and act just like a hydra; you pull one and three more pop up. </p>

          <h2>I wonder???</h2>
          <p class="content-para" >Okay, to be honest, I don't think that teachers read all the body copy that we put inside these websites.  I could have easily copied and pasted some paragraphs from some book or other place. I could have just used a text generator.  But no, I typed each paragraph. As such, I do ask a favor, if you are still reading can you tell me so in your comments?  Otherwise, I do hope you have a great day.  If my fingers were not so sore from all this typing, I would probably tell you a joke. </p>

          <p class="content-para" >In preparation for the weekend, I have been cramming ten days' worth of work and school into one week.  So, to keep people sane at my house, we have been eating a lot of pizza.  In fact, I am eating a cold piece of Hungry Howies right now. It might be time to clean the keyboavienmonsjwlpj.</p>
